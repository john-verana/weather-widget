# Weather Widget

A simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript exercise that displays weather data for three cities and automatically shuffles every five seconds.

## 🎯 Purpose
This small project demonstrates:
- **DOM manipulation** — dynamically changing page content using JavaScript.
- **Timers (`setInterval`)** — updating data at regular intervals.
- **Clean UI structure** — separating HTML, CSS, and JS for clarity and reusability.

## 🧩 Features
- Displays sample weather data for:
  - Las Piñas, PH
  - Parañaque, PH
  - Cavite, PH  
- Shuffles between cities every 5 seconds.
- Lightweight, no external APIs — ideal for beginners learning front-end fundamentals.
